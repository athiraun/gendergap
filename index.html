<p>When the GAO stripped out other factors that come into play—(work patterns, job tenure, industry, occupation, race and marital status) it still found that women earned about 80 percent of what men did:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Even after accounting for key factors that affect earnings,” the authors report, “our model could not explain all of the difference in earnings between men and women.” While it couldn’t definitively say what caused that 20 percent gap, plain old discrimination was one of the few possibilities it highlighted. <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0435.pdf">link</a></p>

<p>It's not limited to male dominated industries:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Women] make less in every industry: among the BLS’s <a href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2011/ted_20110216.htm">thirteen industry categories</a>, women make less than men in every single one. What this means is that even in “women’s fields,” men are going to rake in more. In fact, men have been entering traditionally female-dominated sectors during the recovery period, and as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/21/business/increasingly-men-seek-success-in-jobs-dominated-by-women.html">the New York Times noted</a>, they’re meeting with great success—“men earn more than women even in female-dominated jobs.” </p>

<li><p>Study where science faculty rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the identical female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. Female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. -<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/14/1211286109#aff-1">link</a></p></li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>But surely women don't ask for raises, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Catalyst found that, among those who had moved on from their first post-MBA job, there was no significant difference in the proportion of women and men who asked for increased compensation or a higher position.<br>
Yet the rewards were different.<br>
Women who initiated such conversations and changed jobs post MBA experienced slower compensation growth than the women who stayed put. For men, on the other hand, it paid off to change jobs and negotiate for higher salaries—they earned more than men who stayed did. - <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/for-women-in-business-the-squeaky-wheel-doesnt-get-the-grease/2012/01/09/gIQAGRuqlP_story.html">link</a></p>

<p>So people are just giving men more money? Yup:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A study of 184 managers involved a scenario in which they were told they had a set amount of money to distribute to employees, who had identical skills and responsibilities.<br>
Half the managers were told they might have to give the worker an explanation about the amount of the raise; in other words, they might have to negotiate. This group of managers, both men and women, consistently gave much smaller raises to female employees. In fact, raises for men were nearly 2.5 times larger than those for women, said Maura Belliveau, who did the research at Emory University in Atlanta and is now an associate professor of management at Long Island University in New York.<br>
The second group of managers were told they would not be able to explain their decisions. They gave equal raises to men and women. <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/career-advice/life-at-work/women-may-have-deck-stacked-against-them-when-its-pay-raise-time/article4428087/">link</a></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Weight bias is much costlier for women:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"...women begin to experience noticeable weight bias — such as problems at work or difficulty in personal relationships — when they reach a body mass index, or B.M.I., of 27....But the researchers found that men can bulk up far more without experiencing discrimination. Weight bias against men becomes noticeable when a man reaches a B.M.I. of 35 or higher."<br>
Parker-Pope, Tara (March 31, 2008) "<a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/fat-bias-worse-for-women/?_r=0">Fat Bias Worse for Women</a>". <em>NYTimes</em> referencing "<a href="http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v32/n6/abs/ijo200822a.html">Perceptions of weight discrimination: prevalence and comparison to race and gender discrimination in America</a>"</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weight bias for women is based around beauty (not health) ideals:   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Whereas women are punished for any weight gain, very thin women receive the most severe punishment for their first few pounds of weight gain. This finding is consistent with research showing that the media’s consistent depiction of an unrealistically thin female ideal leads people to see this ideal as normative, expected, and central to female attractiveness (Brown, 2002). Indeed, both our German and American results show that once women reach an average weight, subsequent weight gains are actually penalized to a lesser extent, presumably because the social preferences for a feminine body have already been violated."<br>

<p>In a study of 248 reviews from across 28 companies, Kieran Snyder found that women were vastly more likely to get critical feedback, and receive almost all of the negative personality feedback^1:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When breaking the reviews down by gender of the person evaluated, 58.9% of the reviews received by men contained critical feedback. 87.9% of the reviews received by women did.<br>
Men are given constructive suggestions. Women are given constructive suggestions – and told to pipe down.</p>

<p>"...negative personality criticism—watch your tone! step back! stop being so judgmental!—shows up twice in the 83 critical reviews received by men. It shows up in 71 of the 94 critical reviews received by women.
The manager’s gender isn’t a factor. - <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/08/26/performance-review-gender-bias/">link</a>  </p>

<p>In a pilot study looking at how students assessed online instructors, they gave the instructor they thought was male higher marks in all 12 categories, "regardless of whether the instructor was actually male or female,” MacNell says. “There was no difference between the ratings of the actual male and female instructors.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In other words, students who thought they were being taught by women gave lower evaluation scores than students who thought they were being taught by men. It didn’t matter who was actually teaching them.
The instructor that students thought was a man received markedly higher ratings on professionalism, fairness, respectfulness, giving praise, enthusiasm and promptness.
